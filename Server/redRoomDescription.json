By the looks of it, it seems that the person who lived here hasn't done her or his dishes for a while. The fridge is pretty dusty and the dust is covering the photograph on the fridge. You can't figure out what is in the picture because of all the dust. There is also a staircase leading down to the basement.",

There are also some pictures and the wall, however, you can't seem to see persons' faces in the pictures for some reasons. Every face is blurry. Beneath the pictures there is a small table with a bowl, the bowl contains car keys. There is a staircase leading up to the upper floor.",

Most of it seems to be covered by a red cloth to protect them from getting all dusty, except a ladder which is leaning on the wall. There is a staircase leading up.",
