By the looks of it, it seems that the person who lived here hasn't done her or his dishes for a while. The fridge is old, and it doesn't work anymore, but it has a photograph on it. The photograph might be a clue to all this madness. There are some stairs leading down to the basement.",

Most of it seems to be covered by a red cloth to protect them from getting all dusty, except a ladder which is leaning on the wall, it might be useful later. There are some stairs leading up.",
