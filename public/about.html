    <h1>This project was developed by us, the ENTER:_tainment Team.<h1>
    <p>This project was developed by us, the ENTER:_tainment Team. We are five students from Malmö University. We
      developed this game during our first year, the year 2019, as information architectures. This project was to
      test our ability to create a web application together as a group with the knowledge that we had gained during
      the year. However, the project wasn’t only testing our ability to create but also testing our creativity,
      communication and the different solutions to the different problems that would appear during our development.
      We want to thank everyone who has tested our game during the alpha and beta testing. The feedback that we have
      received was a huge help for us to move forward with our project and see the better picture.

      It wasn’t easy since this was the first time we developed something huge. Although it was fun, and we learned
      a lot from each other and the experience was valuable for our future projects. We want to give a shout out to
      Dachaio for creating the astonishing music piece for the game. We also want to thank Christian Viterius for
      saving us by creating the awesome poster for our game.
